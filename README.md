Assets and code used for the [Metaverse Music Festival 2022](https://decentraland.org/blog/announcements/metaverse-music-festival-2022-everything-there-is-to-know-so-far/) Tower of Babel Scene

## How to deploy

NOTE: This can be deployed by a git action.
Branches are configured to auto deploy.  Merge code ready to release into release branch

* release = production

> Requires an action secret setup named DCL_PRIVATE_KEY that has a private key to a wallet that has operator rights to the parcels you are deploying to 

This folder contains all the necessary files to launch a Decentraland scene.

## Try it out

**Install the CLI**

Download and install the Decentraland CLI by running the following command:

```bash
npm i -g decentraland
```

**Previewing the scene**

Open this folder on the command line, then run:

```
dcl start
```

Any dependencies are installed and then the CLI opens the scene in a new browser tab.

## Deploy to Decentraland

If you own any parcels of land in Decentraland, or have permissions to deploy to someone else's, you can publish this project.

1. Make sure the scene parcels in `scene.json` match those you own or have permissions on.
2. Run `dcl deploy` on the project folder
3. This will open a browser tab to confirm. Metamask will prompt you to sign.
   > Note: Make sure you are using the wallet that owns the parcels or has permissions.

### Deploy to a free server

If you don't own parcels in Decentraland or are not ready to publish your scene to the world, you can share your creations by uploading your scenes to a free hosting service.

See [Upload a preview](https://docs.decentraland.org/development-guide/deploy-to-now/) for instructions on how to do this.
